# Android Kotlin XML Explorations

This repository created to explore the Android Kotlin XML for my personal exploration.

## Activity

File name created based on activity template name, for example Empty Activity will create
`EmptyActivity.kt` file and `activity_empty.xml` layout file.

- Empty Activity
  This most used activity in Android development. By default it create a class and layout file based
  on the name you provided,on level where you create (New Activity) option.
  Generated files:
    - `EmptyActivity.kt`
    - `activity_empty.xml`

- Basic Activity
  This activity is similar to Empty Activity, but it has a menu bar and a floating action button.
  Generated files:
    - `BasicActivity.kt`
    - `activity_basic.xml`
    - `FirstFragment.kt`
    - `fragment_first.xml`
    - `SecondFragment.kt`
    - `fragment_second.xml`
    - `nav_graph.xml`
    - and responsive layout files like `activity_basic.xml (w600dp)`
